# Think You're Stuck? #

Randomizing the game definitely tests how well you know it.
Here's a few places where people commonly get stuck.

1. Unable get all three pendants and can't get the Master Sword to enter Hyrule Castle Tower?  
Try using the cape to enter the tower instead of the Master Sword
2. No Book of Mudora to enter Desert Palace?  
If you have the Ocarina and Titan's Mitt, you can use that instead.  
3. No Fire Rod for use in the Ice Palace?  
Try the Bombos Medallion instead. It makes lots of fire.
3. Need the Hookshot to enter Misery Mire?  
Try using the Pegasus Boots to charge into the block, jumping the gap with the recoil.
