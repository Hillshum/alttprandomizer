# Think You're Stuck? #

Randomizing the game definitely stretches your knowledge of it.
Here's a few places where people commonly get stuck at.

1. Unable get all three pendants and can't get the Master Sword to enter Hyrule Castle Tower?  
Try using the cape to enter the tower instead of the Master Sword
2. No Book of Mudora to enter Desert Palace?  
If you have the Ocarina and Titan's Mitt, you can use that instead.  
3. Need the Hookshot to enter Misery Mire?  
Try using the Pegasus Boots to charge into something and use the recoil to cross the gap.
